##grunt-copy-bower

A grunt plugin that copies bower component files to wherever you want.


I found neither  _grunt-bowercopy_ nor _grunt-bower-copy_ does the intuitive things they should do.[Bower](http://bower.io/) is manager tool for front-end compoents.Every components has its own _bower.json_ which indicates the _main_ file,so copying operation requires no source file but the destination.That is so obvious!
